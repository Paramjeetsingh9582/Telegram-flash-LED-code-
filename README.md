# Telegram-flash-LED-code-
Telegram is a messaging application which is used to send text, images or video messages free of cost. It also allows using other API to create programs to integrate Telegram in their applications. There are special bots which do not need phone number to set up and can be interfaced with any embedded or software application to trigger some event using telegram text messages.

It is a multi-platform messaging service founded by Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov. It rolled out for Android in Alpha on October 20, 2013, and now has an estimated 200 million monthly users.

Telegram's user base tends to increase whenever a privacy scandal hits one of its larger competitors.
